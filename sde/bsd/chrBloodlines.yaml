    description: The Deteis are regarded as the face of leadership in Caldari society.
        Commonly possessed of sharp, ordered minds and articulate tongues, they are
        mostly found in positions of authority within military and political spheres.
        Driven by the cultural premise that the good of the whole must come before
        the needs of the individual, they have made the responsibility of upholding
        the integrity of the entire Caldari State their own.
    femaleDescription: Female Deteis tend be composed individuals with a wry sense
        of humor and a no-nonsense outlook on life. Highly intelligent and ambitious,
        they are much more receptive to bending the rules than their male counterparts,
        provided the reason is sufficient justification on behalf of the greater good.

        male tends to do everything by the book—but does so to impose order and stability
        wherever he goes.

        others. The Empire's defeat at the hands of the mysterious Jovians, and the
        Minmatar uprising that followed, left an indelible mark on Amarrian culture.
        This double failure, a turning point in their history, has shaped an entire
        generation of policy and philosophy among the imperial elite.
    femaleDescription: Amarr females tend to be class-conscious and formal in their
        dealings with others. Masters of subterfuge and machination, they forgive
        little and forget nothing. They are natural matriarchs who are fiercely protective
        of loved ones and obsessed with preserving the integrity of their family name.

        traditionally eschewed by true Amarrians, but still considered a vital part
        of their society.
    femaleDescription: Ni-Kunni females are deceptively engaging individuals. Harboring
        an innate suspicion of others, they often use their charm to probe people
        for weaknesses. They are masters of reading intentions and motives while disguising
        their own emotions, and thus find gainful employ in numerous professions,

        contemplative, moving through the world seemingly without making a ripple.
        Yet their contemplative manner often embraces great beauty through both physical
