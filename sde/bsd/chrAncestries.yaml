    description: A number of Khanid were unhappy with the break from the Amarr Empire.
        While they never resorted to armed resistance, they are pleased by the improving
        relations with the Empire and hope the two nations will unite once more. They
        are eager to do whatever is necessary to achieve this, including taking on
        the common enemies of the Empire and the Kingdom.

    description: The Khanid are not generally known to be as devout as the Amarrians,
        but those who are tend to be fanatics even by Amarrian standards. Religious
        Khanids are often inducted into zealous cults, generally based on their interpretation
        of the Scriptures. The Amarrians regard these religious Khanids with suspicious
        interest; on the one hand the cultists' extremism alarms them, but on the
        other their religious fervor often results in deep theosophical insights.

    description: Drawing inspiration from their nomadic ancestry, wanderlust runs
        strong with many Vherokiors. While many curb their thirst for adventure, there
        are those who simply cannot settle down in one place for long. Never at rest,
        they will always be lured by the horizon, as there are places to see and riches
        to be discovered.

    description: Vherokiors have always seemed strange to the other Minmatar tribes,
        doubly so when it comes to those with mystical inclinations. Vherokior mystics
        are both revered and feared by the Minmatar. The ancient Voluval ritual, where
        the soul and karma of the person is revealed through the unexplained emergence
        of a body tattoo on the recipient, was created by Vherokior mystics, and its
        secrets are closely guarded.

        of the stores or restaurants lining the vast promenades. Odds are that it
        is owned and operated by a Vherokior. Determined merchants and peddlers since
        their caravan days, their business enterprises and expertise have spread steadily
        throughout the Republic.
