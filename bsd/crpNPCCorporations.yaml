        War, the Syndicate has slowly grown in stature and influence. It now serves
        as an important link between the empires and the illegal elements in the outer
        regions. Syndicate space is a pirate haven but still retains enough civility
        to allow pretty much anyone to travel there for business. Its markets are
        always chock full of contraband goods and illegal wares that are hard or impossible
        to come by elsewhere. Each Syndicate station is an autonomous entity, but
        they cooperate on security and information issues. The unofficial leader of
        the Syndicate is Silphy en Diabel, a former Sister of EVE who returned to
        Syndicate space to save her family's fortune. Since then she's turned out
        to be just as resourceful and ruthless as her late father.

        the behavior of rogue drones in the Algintal constellation, the Algintal Core
        have maintained a clinical care and attention in everything they do, even
        after cutting formal ties with the original research effort and Federation
        military alike. Exposure to the realities of corporate life has inevitably
        added a certain cynicism to the attitudes of the founding operatives, which
        has served them well as suppliers in the military services sector.

        as 'kelkoons', an archaic Brutor word signifying a veteran warrior. The owners
        of the Sanmatar Kelkoons seek to play on that heritage even though their mercenaries
        have absolutely no connection to the present Sanmatar or the Republic military.
        Minmatar tribalists may consider this usage outrageous but the long history
        of abusing this terminology almost amounts to a tradition in itself. For their
        part, the Sanmatar Kelkoons continue to attract top rates for the services
        of their mercenary forces.

        Onikanabo accept contracts without fear or favor.

        existed before the Amarr invaded and occupied Matar. Even so, the Eyniletti
        Rangers, now a paramilitary scouting and exploration corporation, have justly
        acquired a record of completing the contracts they accept to the satisfaction
        of their employers.

        renegade clan noted for slash and burn raids on remote colonies, it is perhaps
        no surprise. Probably even less surprising is the willingness of many in New

    description: "The Navka Overminds are a form of rogue drone swarm that can be
        encountered in significant numbers throughout Abyssal Deadspace wherever Triglavian
        infrastructure is present. The designation 'Navka' seems to have some relationship
        to a subdivision of the Triglavian race that runs across the so-called 'clades'.\r\n\r\nIt
        would seem that the Navka Overminds are either entirely suborned to Triglavian
        purposes or, perhaps more worryingly, are willingly working with them."
